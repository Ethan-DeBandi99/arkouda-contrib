# Cython Integration

The purpose of this module is to demonstrate how to leverage functionality written in python in Chapel. This process uses `Cython` to compile `Python` code as `C`. This can be an easier entry point to utilizing Chapel than having to directly write large amounts of complex Chapel code.
